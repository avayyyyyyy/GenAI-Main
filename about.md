## Introduction

Hi everyone, this is Shubhankit from Team 20. We're excited to introduce our project, StoryWeaver, designed to solve a common problem faced by modern parents. In today's fast-paced world, many parents return home late from work, often too exhausted to create and narrate new bedtime stories for their children. Our solution is a website called StoryWeaver that addresses this issue by generating personalized bedtime stories.

## Problem Statement

Parents often struggle to find the time and energy to create new bedtime stories for their children every night. Children love hearing bedtime stories, especially ones that involve them as the main character. Our goal is to provide a solution that helps parents create engaging and personalized bedtime stories effortlessly.

## Solution: StoryWeaver Website

StoryWeaver is a website that allows parents to generate personalized bedtime stories for their children. Here's how it works:

1. **User Login:**

   - The user logs in to the StoryWeaver website.

2. **Image Upload:**

   - After logging in, the user is directed to an image upload page.
   - The user uploads a photo of their child (or anyone they want to feature in the story).

3. **Story Customization:**

   - The user is redirected to the story customization page.

   - The backend server uses advanced AI models to generate a unique bedtime story based on the provided inputs.

5. **Image Integration:**

   - The generated story includes illustrations.
   - These illustrations are customized by swapping the faces in the images with the uploaded photo of the child.
   - The face-swapping feature is managed through an API that ensures the child’s face is seamlessly integrated into the illustrations.

6. **Final Story:**
   - The final personalized bedtime story, featuring the child as the main character, is presented to the user.
   - The story can be viewed online or downloaded for offline reading.
