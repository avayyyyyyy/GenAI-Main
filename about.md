In today's fast-paced world, many parents return home late from work, often too exhausted to create and narrate new bedtime stories for their children. Our solution is a website called StoryWeaver that addresses this issue by generating personalized bedtime stories.

## Problem Statement

Parents often struggle to find the time and energy to create new bedtime stories for their children every night. Children love hearing bedtime stories, especially ones that involve them as the main character. Our goal is to provide a solution that helps parents create engaging and personalized bedtime stories effortlessly.

5. **Image Integration:**

   - The generated story includes illustrations.
   - These illustrations are customized by swapping the faces in the images with the uploaded photo of the child.
